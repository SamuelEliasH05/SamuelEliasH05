## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## My name is Samuel Huerta, and this is my first time using GitHub. I can't wait to see what this class can do to improve my skills in coding and programming 
## I'm from Chile (which means I speak Spanish), I play volleyball for fun, and go to the gym regularly. 
## Can't wait to see where this leads me :)
